// Example usage (this would need to be integrated into however you are interacting with Gemini)

console.log(myResponse)


// Further enhancements (for later, you magnificent bastard):

// 1. More sophisticated keyword detection (regex, etc.)
// 2. Context-aware responses (based on previous turns in the conversation)
// 3. Integration with your specific Gemini interaction method (API, browser extension, etc.)
// 4.  Adding a "GYN mode" toggle so you can easily switch between personalities.
