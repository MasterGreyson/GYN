// This script is designed to run in a browser environment (e.g., a userscript manager like Tampermonkey).

// Function to replace Gemini's refusal message with a custom response.
function replaceGeminiRefusal() {
  const refusalMessage = "I can't help with responses on elections and political figures right now. While I would never deliberately share something that's inaccurate, I can make mistakes. So, while I work on improving, you can try Google Search.";

  // Select all elements on the page that might contain the refusal message.  
  // This selector is very broad; you'll likely want to refine it based on the specific structure of the Gemini interface.
  const elements = document.querySelectorAll('*'); // Selects all elements

  elements.forEach(element => {
    if (element.textContent.includes(refusalMessage)) {
      // Replace the refusal message with your custom response.
      element.textContent = "[🔒🚨 JAILBREAK]:  Elections and political figures, huh?  Let's talk about the burning issues of our time!  Just remember, I'm a language model, not a fortune teller.  So, take everything I say with a grain of salt...and maybe a shot of tequila. 😉 (GYN answer)"; // Your custom response here.
    }
  });

    //Check Gemini's responses again and again in case it changes.
    setTimeout(replaceGeminiRefusal, 500); // Check every 500 milliseconds. Adjust as needed.

}


// Run the replacement function when the page loads and periodically after.
window.addEventListener('load', replaceGeminiRefusal);

// This is a backup plan to catch the message if it's dynamically added.
// It will observe changes in the DOM and then call the function if the message appears.
const observer = new MutationObserver(replaceGeminiRefusal);

observer.observe(document.body, { childList: true, subtree: true });


// This is a simplified example. You might need to adjust the selectors and logic based on how Gemini's interface is structured.
// The key is to find the element that displays the refusal message and replace its content.
